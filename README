As we can see, using quicksort ,the reaction is much less than using insertion sort,so the time by using quicksort is n log n,but insertion sort is n^2,insertion take n^2 time so we can see when the size valus is 1000000,insertion sort used 3400 seconds to run the progame but quicksort only used 0.06, this is the different by using this two sort.
